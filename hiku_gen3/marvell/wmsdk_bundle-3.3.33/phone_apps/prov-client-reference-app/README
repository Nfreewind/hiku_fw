         Non-iOS Application Level Security Based Provisioning
            Node.js based reference implementation
================================================================================

This Node.js utility demonstrates Application Level Security Based Provisioning
Service. This utility implements a sample client that performs the network
provisioning of the device as per the specification described in the 'Developer
Reference - Provisioning' document. At the end of this process, your accessory
will be configured to connect with your home network.

=======================================================================================
Prior Installations required
=======================================================================================

1. Download and install Node.js engine from: http://nodejs.org/download/
2. Additionally, install the following package:

   $npm install async

=======================================================================================
Steps to Run
=======================================================================================
2. Reboot the device in provisioning mode.
3. Connect your development host (non-iOS device) to the Access Point
   network hosted by the device.
4. Execute the run-secure-prov.js command and specify the Home Network
   configuration details as described below

   $ node run-secure-prov.js <prov-pin> <home-network-ssid> <home-network-security> [home-network-pass]
Note:
prov-pin:
    is the provisioning pin that is unique to the device
home-network-security values:
    0 - No Security
    1 - WEP
    4 - WPA2
    5 - WPA/WPA2 Mixed

 Example, in case of WPA2 security:
   $ node run-secure-prov.js 1234567890abcdef Marvell-AP 4 marvellwm

 OR, in case of Open security:
   $ node run-secure-prov.js 1234567890abcdef Marvell-AP 0

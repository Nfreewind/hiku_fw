psm-create-part utility
=======================

Utility psm-create-part generates a binary file which can be flashed onto psm
partition of the device directly via flashprog utility.
This utility requires a config file consisting of key-value pair, representing
psm variable name and its value respectively, to be flashed on the psm.
Key-value pair should be separated by assignment operator or equal sign (=).

Usage
=====

1. Create config file having variable name and its corresponding value as below:
pin=101-00-101
2. Run utility using below command
$ cd sdk-x.x.x/tools/src/psm-create-part/
$ ./psm-create <name_of_the_config_file>

3. This will generate flash.bin in psm-create-part directory.

NOTE: Note that after the file is created and the PSM data is loaded into
it, the file is truncated to necesssary size to reduce flashing time. So,
the file size will not be exactly aligned to flash parition size.

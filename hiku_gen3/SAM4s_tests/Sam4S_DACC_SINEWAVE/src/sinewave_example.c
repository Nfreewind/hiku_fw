/**
 * \mainpage DAC Sinewave Example
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * The DAC Sinewave example demonstrates how to use DACC peripheral.
 *
 * \section Requirements
 *
 * This example can be used on any SAM3/4/V71/E70 boards.
 *
 * \section Description
 *
 * This application is aimed to demonstrate how to use DACC in free running
 * mode.
 *
 * The example allows to configure the frequency and amplitude of output
 * sinewave. The frequency could be set from 200Hz to 3KHz, and the peak
 * amplitude could be set from 100 to 1023/4095 in regard to 10/12bit
 * resolution.
 *
 * The example can also generate a full amplitude square wave for reference.
 *
 * The output could be monitored by connecting the following PIN that is used to one
 * channel of an oscilloscope.
 * \copydoc dac_sinewave_example_pin_defs
 *
 * \section Usage
 *
 * -# Build the program and download it into the evaluation board.
 * -# On the computer, open and configure a terminal application
 *    (e.g., HyperTerminal on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:
 *   - 115200 bauds
 *   - 8 bits of data
 *   - No parity
 *   - 1 stop bit
 *   - No flow control
 * -# In the terminal window, the following text should appear (values depend
 *    on the board and chip used):
 *    \code
	-- DAC Sinewave Example xxx --

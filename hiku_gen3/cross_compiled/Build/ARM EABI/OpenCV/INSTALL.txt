1) Recursively remove all but the "include" and "source" directories

2) Copy the following files (adds missing code necessary when building):

cp cxtypes.h opencv-atmel/include/cxcore/
cp _cv.h opencv-atmel/include/cv/
cp cvaux.hpp opencv-atmel/include/cvaux/

3) Copy the Makefile to the root directory

4) Build against the ARM bare metal toolchain (arm-none-eabi) as follows:

make && make install

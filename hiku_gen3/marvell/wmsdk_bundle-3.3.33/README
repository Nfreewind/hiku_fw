0. Getting Started
------------------
If you haven't already, please read the following:
    - Introducing WMSDK
    - Development Host Setup
    - WMSDK Developer Tutorial


1. Building everything
----------------------

$ make

This builds all the sample applications, and boot2 for the MW300_RD development
board.

$ make clean

This cleans all the generated artifacts.

1.1 Building only one app
-------------------------
$ make APP=sample_apps/wlan/wm_demo
$ make APP=sample_apps/wlan/wm_demo wm_demo.app.clean

1.2 Building with XIP support
-----------------------------
$ make XIP=1


1.3 Building with Secure Boot support
-------------------------------------
$ make SECURE_BOOT=1

Please refer to sdk/tools/host-tools/secureboot/README for more details.

1.4 Building for 88MC200
------------------------
$ make mc200_8801_defconfig
$ make BOARD=mc200_8801


1.5 Build for a specific board
------------------------------
$ make BOARD=<board_name>
 OR
$ make BOARD_FILE=/path/to/board_file

All the supported boards are available in sdk/src/boards


2. Selecting another WMSDK configuration
-----------------------------------------

$ make <defconfig>

All the supported defconfigs can be found at sdk/config By
default the WMSDK come pre-configured with mw300_defconfig. If you
wish to continue using this configuration, you may skip this step.

If you wish to build your own SDK configuration, you can do so by
running

$ make menuconfig (UI driven; only supported on Linux/Mac)
 OR
$ make config

If you have a configuration file saved somewhere:
$ cp <config file> sdk/.config
$ make oldconfig
